## Installation
There are two ways to use SimpleNetworkingKit in your project:
- using Swift Package Manager
- manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate SimpleNetworkingKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/gmoral/SimpleNetworkingKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
